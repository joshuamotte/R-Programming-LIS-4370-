# Data Cleansing and Regression

This R package provides tools for dealing with NA and outlier values, creating
quick correlations between every variable, and running regression models on data
sets with LM, SVM, KSVM, and Random Forest. It also uses MAE, RMSE, and the R
squared value to evaluate each model's accuracy. You can then plot each model and
show the standard error of each model compared to the actual data.
